# Using Elixir for Server-Side Web Dev

## Debugging
* iex -S mix
* :debugger.start()
* :int.ni(YourModule)

## In-Class Examples
* did tick.ex example
* did pmap.ex example

## A new Phoenix app

* complain about ipv6 to the school
* in the lib/ is where the Elixir source code is
    - demo vs demo_web is that the demo_web is for swapping U/I
    - find application.ex
    - application still started up with "iex -S mix"

* A web server can be thought of as a pure function (mostly):
    - HTTP Req => HTTP Resp
    - check out the router.ex file
    - Plugs
        * Gives you an interface for function that map
        * Stores the HTTP request and the partially constructed response in a structure called a "Conn"
        * map Conn => Conn
    - PageController in the controllers directory

* For each HTTP request:
    - Router
    - Initial Plugs
    - Controller function
    - View (convention PageController paired with page_view.)
    - Template

* Prof Tuck added form to the index.html.eex
    - We didn't have a route for the POST / form
    - So we had to add a route
    - Made a corresponding function in the page condtroller
    - Check out what _params is wiht an IO.inspect
    - (Will talk about CSRF later)
    - We need a :protect_from_forgery plug (but we can disable)
    - Pay attention to what's displayed on stdout when making HTTP requests
    ```<form action="/form" method="post">
            <p><input id=name> </input></p>
            <p><button>Submit</button></p>```

* Make another page to display form
    - Print out response to form on a different page
    - check out the <% @name %> variable interpolation stuff
    - generates
    - can somehow do keyword list as parameter with Elixir functions'
    - can check out cookies, click on the HTTP requests to see the headers set-cookie

* Production secret file
    - Need to check this out so as not to spoof cookies
    - Do not put the session keys in your git repo
    - uid to be admin

* Next session we'll be talking about Elixir
